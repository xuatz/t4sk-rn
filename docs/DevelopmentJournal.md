- seems like scheduled background local notifications works great
- next up need to try if i can run background task and send a local notification
  - query database for number of records, put that number in the notification

- found out that Notifications package for @react-native-firebase v6 is not ready yet
- https://github.com/wix/react-native-notifications doesnt have local notification yet
- going to use this instead https://github.com/zo0r/react-native-push-notification
